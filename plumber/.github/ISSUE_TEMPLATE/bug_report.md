### System details

Output of `sessioninfo::session_info()()`:

```
# sessioninfo::session_info() output goes here
```

### Example application *or* steps to reproduce the problem

<!-- If you're able to create one, a `reprex::reprex` (REProducible EXample, https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) is extremely helpful to us. For instructions on how to create good reprex, please see: https://reprex.tidyverse.org/articles/reprex-dos-and-donts.html .  We understand the interactive nature of plumber, having two separate reprex outputs (generating the server and calling server) is perfectly acceptable.  -->

```R
# Minimal, self-contained example API code goes here
